Backlog {
	* Godot scene importer lib.
	* Script to find unimplemented raylib functions. Should have list for fuctions that will not
	get implemented.
	* Raygui lib
		* Check if could remove flickering from changing draw order by making queue for order changing and only
		change them after everything is drawn.
	* Platform desktop SDL
		* Text input not working on gui. Could this be Raylib issue?
		* Haptic functions.
	* Audio
		* AudioStream.
	* Core
		* Automation events functionality.
	* Models
		* Mesh bone weight management?

	* Examples
		* Improve Dungeon crawler example by generating custom mesh instead of drawing 3D quads.
		* Platformer example physics process for true framerate independence.
	* Android support
	* Git submodules for raylib and lua. Should maybe find windows compatible lua repo for this.
}

Bugs {
	* glfwSet*Callback functions segfault on Windows. Should keep Lua events off.
}

Needs Testing {
	* rlSetUniform
	* rlSetShader
	* rlReadShaderBuffer
