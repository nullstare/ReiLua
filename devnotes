Backlog {
	* SDL_Desktop platform option. Might have to move events to platform specific file since events are not
	the same in different platforms.
	* Text
		* Text codepoints management functions (unicode characters)? Could be usefull for luajit.
		* Some of the Text strings management functions could be easier to use than the Lua ones.
		* LoadFontFromMemory.
		* LoadFontData.
		* GenImageFontAtlas.
	* Audio
		* AudioStream.
	* Models
		* More Model management functions. Get mesh and material etc.
		* BoneInfo.
		* LoadMaterialsFromModel (Could then for example edit and set back to model).

	* Examples
		* Improve Dungeon crawler example by generating custom mesh instead of drawing 3D quads.
		* Platformer example physics process for true framerate independence.
	* Android support
}

Bugs {
